This section attempts to give a brief introduction to the PyFileServer application package.


WSGI Application
================

PyFileServer is a WSGI application.

WSGI <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html> stands for Web Server Gateway
Interface, a proposed standard interface between web servers and Python web 
applications or frameworks, to promote web application portability across a 
variety of web servers. If you are unfamiliar with WSGI, do take a moment to 
read the PEP. Most WSGI application consists middleware which serve as pre-filters and 
post-processors, and the actual application.

PyFileServer::

 Request -> PyFileApp (container)
                  |
                  +-> ErrorPrinter (middleware)
                           |
                     RequestResolver (middleware)
                           |
                   HTTPAuthenticator (middleware)
                           |
                     RequestServer (application)
                                                
                                                
In addition, PyFileServer comes with an existing WSGI webserver so that the
application can be run as a standalone program.


The PyFileServer application consists of the following modules::
   
   Bundled Web Server:
         ext_wsgiutils_server 
   
   Application objects: 
         pyfileserver.mainappwrapper
            + class PyFileApp
      
         pyfileserver.processrequesterrorhandler    
            + class ErrorPrinter
            + Exception HTTPRequestException
      
         pyfileserver.requestresolver
            + class RequestResolver
         
         pyfileserver.httpauthentication
            + class HTTPAuthenticator
            + class SimpleDomainController    
         
         pyfileserver.pyfiledomaincontroller
            + class PyFileServerDomainController    
         
         pyfileserver.extrequestserver    
            + class RequestServer
      
         pyfileserver.propertylibrary    
            + class LockManager
            + class PropertyManager
      
         pyfileserver.etagprovider    
            + func object getETag
   
   Miscellaneous libraries:
         pyfileserver.websupportfuncs    
         pyfileserver.loadconfig_primitive    
         pyfileserver.httpdatehelper
